"""Helper module to work around platform limitations where V6ONLY=0 can be set,
but getaddrinfo can not deal with AI_V4MAPPED; this is currently known to
affect only Android.

The emulation is enabled depending on
:func:`aiocoap.defaults.use_ai_v4mapped_emulation`.

Unless Python is used with optimization enabled, emulation will be run on all
getaddrinfo calls in addition to the regular call, and a warning is shown if
they disagree.

Future development
------------------

It may be that for proper happy-eyeballs support, AI_V4MAPPED is not quite the
right way to go: It will show a mapped address only if there are no V6 results
-- whereas on links without V6 connectivity, one would like to receive both
results and try them in order.
